### What Gaphor Currently Generates From

Gaphor's current model-code pipeline generates Python model modules from checked-in Gaphor model files, not from arbitrary external Ecore, MOF XMI, or Eclipse XMI.

- `pyproject.toml` defines `poe` tasks that call `gaphor.codegen.coder:main`.
- `gaphor.codegen.coder` loads `.gaphor` model files through `gaphor.storage.load`.
- Current generated modules include `gaphor/core/modeling/coremodel.py`, `gaphor/UML/uml.py`, `gaphor/SysML/sysml.py`, `gaphor/RAAML/raaml.py`, and `gaphor/C4Model/c4model.py`.
- `tests/test_models_up_to_date.py` verifies generated output equals the checked-in generated modules.

This means M1a must prove an adapter path from normative SysML/KerML artifacts into the Gaphor generator's accepted model shape before the KerML kernel is built on it.

### Which SysML2 Artifacts Are Usable

Usable M0 inputs:

- OMG formal SysML 2.0 and KerML 1.0 specification documents for conformance authority.
- OMG normative MOF XMI for the SysML and KerML abstract syntax as metamodel source input.
- OMG normative KPAR library artifacts for standard-library interchange when that phase arrives.
- JSON schemas for abstract syntax and project interchange, mainly for future validation and API alignment.
- Systems Modeling Community release BNF files as parser seed material, cross-checked against the formal PDFs.
- Textual standard-library files in the release repository as readable fixtures and cross-checks, not as the sole conformance authority.

### Normative vs Reference Artifacts

Normative for this effort:

- OMG formal SysML 2.0 Language specification.
- OMG formal KerML 1.0 specification.
- OMG MOF XMI abstract syntax files for SysML and KerML.
- OMG KPAR model interchange projects listed as normative machine-readable documents.

Reference or convenience artifacts:

- Systems Modeling Community release repository packaging.
- Extracted `.kebnf`, `.kgbnf`, and HTML BNF files. They are derived from the specifications and useful for parser work, but must be checked against the formal docs when ambiguity or correction notes appear.
- Release repository XMI library representations using Eclipse XMI. Release notes state these are not fully normative OMG XMI.
- Pilot implementation behavior and Xtext grammar. These are useful comparators, not automatic conformance authority.

### Realistic Generator Path

Use a two-step generator strategy:

1. M1a imports a small normative MOF XMI slice into an intermediate mapping model and emits one generated, semantics-free Gaphor `Base` subclass with generated attributes and references.
2. Only after that generated class persists and reloads through `.gaphor`, extend the path to the minimal KerML kernel in M1b.

Do not hand-author the KerML or SysML metamodel as production code unless M1a proves the generation path unviable and a new human-approved plan replaces this decision.

## Grammar Tool

Decision: use Lark for the first SysML v2 textual grammar.

Tradeoff:

- Lark is pure Python, fits Gaphor packaging better, supports EBNF-style grammar composition, and is simple to exercise in pytest.
- ANTLR tracks the broader tooling ecosystem more closely and has a mature grammar workflow, but adds a Java-oriented toolchain and generated parser lifecycle that is heavier for Gaphor.

The grammar is one layered grammar: SysML textual notation extends KerML textual notation. Port from the BNF, not from intuition. Pilot/Xtext behavior may be used to understand ambiguities, not as the source of truth.

## Spec Version Pin

Pin to:

- SysML 2.0 formal, September 2025.
- KerML 1.0 formal, September 2025.
- Systems Modeling API and Services 1.0 formal only for identity/API alignment notes, not implementation in this kickoff.
- OMG `20250201` machine-readable artifacts for SysML and KerML abstract syntax and library KPARs.
- Systems Modeling Community release tag `2026-03` as the current convenience bundle for formal documents, BNF extraction files, and reference libraries.

Update policy: changing the pin requires a mapping decision update, support-matrix review, and focused regression fixtures for affected grammar, metamodel, library, and round-trip behavior.

## Element Identity

Repository identity uses Gaphor's native `Base.id` and `ElementFactory` ownership of elements.

Do not introduce a parallel repository id. Add a SysML/API-facing `elementId` only when API or export compatibility requires it. Round-trip equivalence never depends on either Gaphor ids or imported textual ids.

Keep these identities distinct:

- Gaphor internal `Base.id`.
- SysML/API-facing `elementId`, if introduced later.
- Text import ids minted during import.
- Canonical round-trip identity, based on structure and resolved references.

## Round-Trip Equivalence

Round-trip equivalence is canonical structural comparison over:

- element types,
- ownership tree,
- memberships,
- typing and specialization relations,
- references resolved to their target by canonical path,
- documentation,
- qualified names.

It explicitly excludes text formatting and Gaphor element id equality.

## Name Resolution Target Design

Full target:

- unqualified lookup through owner namespaces,
- simple and nested qualified-name lookup,
- imports,
- inherited members,
- visibility,
- aliases,
- nested namespaces,
- implicit specialization,
- feature chains,
- diagnostics for ambiguous and unresolved names.

M2 scope only:

- same-namespace lookup,
- simple qualified-name lookup,
- unresolved-symbol diagnostic.

Do not implement inheritance, visibility, aliases, or feature chains during the first tracer.
